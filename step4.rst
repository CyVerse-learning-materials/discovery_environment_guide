Managing Analyses
--------------------------------------------------------------------


An analysis is the product of a launched app that has completed its computation of input data. The Discovery Environment maintains a history of all your analyses, including a unique analysis ID, launch date, input files, and other details.

*Browsing Analyses*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must be logged in to manage analyses.

1. Open the **Analyses** view by clicking on |analyses icon| on the left sidebar of the DE interface to monitor the status of your submitted analysis. The analysis launched most recently will be at the top of the list.


2. Analyses can be sorted by Name, Start date, End date or Status. To sort your analyses, hover over the name of the column you wish to sort by and click on the arrow that appears beside the column name.


3. To filter your analyses by user, click on the View dropdown menu in the upper left corner and select either 'My analyses' or 'Shared with me'. The default view is 'My analysesâ€™.


4. To further filter your analyses by app type, click on the Filter dropdown menu and select the type of analyses you would like to see (i.e., HPC, DE, VICE, or OSG).


5. To open and view the output folder of a completed analysis, click on the output folder icon |output folder icon| at the right side of that particular analysis.
