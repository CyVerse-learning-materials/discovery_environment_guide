Logging In
----------

When you first arrive at |the DE|, you'll see the Dashboard. You can freely explore the Dashboard information, but to perform any tasks, you must have an account and be logged in.

-----

*Viewing the Dashboard*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Dashboard provides an overview of recent activity in CyVerse and the Discovery Environment. Here you can see CyVerse-related news and events, video tutorials, and newly released public apps. Also, items specific to your activity will appear here, such as your recently launched analyses and newly integrated apps that you've been working on. The Dashboard's left sidebar shows icons for accessing Data, Apps, Analyses, Teams, and Help. You can log in from the Dashboard to get started.


*Logging in*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To log in from the Dashboard, click the profile icon in the upper right corner of the DE, or click `SIGN IN` when you encounter this message:

|DE Login Required|

1. Log into the Discovery Environment at |discovery environment| with your username and password.

.. Tip::    If you forgot your password, you can reset it at the |CyVerse User Portal|.

2. After logging in with your username and password, you'll be returned to the view that you were previously on. For example, if you were on the Apps view, then clicked `SIGN IN[d]`, you'll return to that view after logging in.

You can take a short tour of the DE by clicking the |person_icon| (person icon) in the upper right corner of the screen and selecting "Introduction".
