in the dialog, after the analysis name, details, and parameter group panels defined by that app. If required, the user may adjust these minimum resource requirements so that the analysis may be submitted with requests for larger minimum resources. Note that this may cause those analyses to wait longer in the submission queue until a node that matches those minimum requirements becomes available. So generally users may wish to leave the resource requests set to the defaults that the tool or app integrator has set. Single Step Apps If there is only 1 step in the analysis, then one \\\"Resource Requirements\\\" panel will be appended to the App Launch dialog. {width=\"475px\" height=\"275px\"} Workflows If there is more than 1 step in the analysis, then each step in the workflow will append its own \\\"Resource Requirements\\\" panel. {width=\"475px\" height=\"275px\"} Resource Limits The drop-downs for each requirement are populated with the same values available to tool integrators in the DE\\'s add/edit private tool dialog. 0,1,2,4,8 minimum CPU 0,2,4,8,16 GiB minimum memory 0,1,2,4,8, and doubling each additional step up to 512GiB minimum disk space If a step defines minimum CPU, RAM, or disk requirements, those values will be populated by default in that step\\'s \\\"Resource Requirements\\\" panel. Additionally, min and max values set for these resources are used to limit which options are available in that resource\\'s drop-down. For example, the following tool has 3.4 min CPU, 4GiB max memory, and 4GiB min disk space defined. So the \\\"Resource Requirements\\\" panel in the launch dialog for an app using this tool will set 3.4 min CPU cores and 4GiB min disk space by default. {width=\"475px\" height=\"278px\"} Additionally, if the user wishes to adjust the minimum CPU requirements, then only the options 0, 4, and 8 will be available. Similarly for memory, only 0, 2, and 4GiB options will be available; and for disk, the options for 1 and 2 GiB will not be available (since those are below the 4GiB minimum defined by the tool). Selecting a \\'0\\' in any of these drop-downs has the effect of requesting no requirement for that resource in the analysis submission. VICE Limits As another example, our internal docs for creating VICE tools used to instruct admins to use 0.1 min CPUs, 2 max CPUs, and 4,000,000,000 max memory. So the \\\"Resource Requirements\\\" panel for the following \\\"jupyter-lab\\\" app will use 0.1 min CPUs by default, and limit the CPU options to 0, 1, or 2 CPUs. Minimum memory will not be auto-filled by default, but will be limited to only 0 or 2GiB for the user, since the 4,000,000,000 max memory limit is just less than the next 4GiB option. {width=\"475px\" height=\"275px\"} Fix or improve this documentation Search for an answer: Ask us for help: click on the lower right-hand side of the page Report an issue or submit a change: Send feedback: Tutorials@CyVerse.org","title":"Analyses resource reqs"},{"location":"analyses_resource_reqs/#analysis-resource-requests","text":"In an App Launch dialog, \\\"Resource Requirement\\\" panels will always be appended as the last step in the dialog, after the analysis name, details, and parameter group panels defined by that app. If required, the user may adjust these minimum resource requirements so that the analysis may be submitted with requests for larger minimum resources.

Click in the left sidebar of the DE to see the Apps view. When you first access the Apps view, you may be prompted to log in. After logging in, you will see a screen that looks something like this: Sorting and Filtering Apps in the Discovery Environment \u00b6 To sort the list of apps in ascending or descending order by app name, the name of the person who integrated the app in CyVerse, or its average rating, click on the column headings. You can navigate between pages and change how many apps are listed on a page by using the \\< or > controls at the bottom of the page. By default, the Apps view displays all apps that are available to you. With hundreds of apps and sometimes many versions of an app in the DE, you may want to view a subset of all available apps. There are two ways to do this. First, in the upper left corner of the Apps view, the currently active subset of apps is shown as the primary filter. Click the drop-down arrow next to the currently active subset to select a different apps subset to display: The currently selected app subset is highlighted in gray. The available app subsets are: Application type Description Apps under development Apps that you have added to the DE that have not been made public Favorite apps Apps that you have marked as favorite apps in the DE My public apps Apps that you have added to the DE that have been made publicly available Shared with me Apps that other users have shared with you High-Performance Computing Apps that run at the Texas Advanced Computing Center using the Browse All Apps All apps available to you in the DE You can further reduce the list of the apps displayed by selecting a filter.
