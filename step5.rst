Using Search in the Discovery Environment
----------------------------------------------


Use Search from anywhere in the Discovery Environment to find *Data*, *Apps*, and *Analyses*. The Search box is located at the top of the page.


------


*Searching Data, Apps, and Analyses in the Discovery Environment*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To search, you do not need to be logged in, however you must log in to perform any tasks with data, apps or analyses.

1. In the Search box, start typing at least the first three characters of the name of the item of interest. Search will automatically begin (within the default “All” resources) once you have typed three or more characters of the item name.


2. Search results will be displayed as a dropdown list grouped by **Apps**, **Analyses**, or **Data**.


.. Tip::
   To limit your search to just **Apps** or **Analyses** or **Data**, click the dropdown arrow on the right side of the Search box and select the desired filter.


3. Click on the desired result from the listing.


.. Tip::
   Only the top **10 results** are shown by default. To see all the results associated with a *search term*, including “Community Data” or “Shared with Me” results for Data, hit the *enter* key after the *search term* or select the option similar to *View all analyses results for fasta* from the results dropdown.
