# Sharing and Using Bags in the Discovery Environment

You can share data, apps, and analyses using the sharing features with
one or more CyVerse users through the Discovery Environment. The "Bag"
is a handy feature in the DE that you can use to gather and download or
share multiple data files, apps, and analyses or any combination of
those resources with another user(s). There is no limit to the number of
items you can put in a bag but you can only share files you own.

## *Sharing Data in the Discovery Environment*

You must be logged in to share resources.

1.  Open the **Data** view of your home directory by clicking on in the
    left sidebar.

2.  Select the data resource(s) you wish to share; then click the Share
    button.

3.  In the Sharing dialog that opens, check that the resources you wish
    to share are shown.

4.  In the Search checkbox, search for the CyVerse user(s) you wish to
    share with by typing their full CyVerse username or email address.
    Subsequent searches will more quickly find names from your previous
    "Shared with" lists.

5.  Next, under \"Permission\", choose which type of permission to grant
    the person(s) you are sharing resources with. You can also "Remove"
    access using the Permission dialog box.

6.  When you are finished, click \"Done\" to begin sharing. The user(s)
    will be notified that resources have been shared with them and will
    see the shared item(s) in their "Shared With Me" folder when they
    log in.

    share is shown.

    username, team name, or email address of the CyVerse user(s) with
    whom you want to share. Search will start when you enter at least
    three characters. There is no limit to how many users you can share
    files and analyses with.

5.  Next, under \"Permission\", choose which type of permission you want
    to grant the person(s) or team you are sharing the app(s) with.

6.  Once you are finished, click "Done" to begin sharing. The user(s)
    will be notified that app(s) have been shared with them when they

    There is no limit to how many users you can share analyses with.

    grant the person(s) you are sharing the analyses with.

## *Using a Bag to Share or Download in the Discovery Environment*

You can share or download multiple items using the (bag icon) feature in

    view (or each consecutively), select one or more files, and click
    "Add to Bag" in the upper right corner. A red dot will appear on the
    (bag icon) to show how many resources are currently in the bag.
2.  There is no limit to the number of items you can share in a bag.
3.  When you've finished adding all the files (data, apps or analyses)
    you want to share in the bag, share the bag with another CyVerse
    user(s) by clicking on the (bag icon). In the dialog box that opens,
    all the files you have put in the bag are listed by default. Use the
    dropdown arrow to show downloadable or shareable files.
4.  You can "Share" the contents of the bag by clicking on the "Share"
    button. Another dialog box will open where you can set Permissions
    for the user(s) with whom you are sharing files.

    and then click on each of the links for the files.
6.  Sharing or downloading the contents of a bag does not empty the bag.
    You can share the same contents with another user(s); to empty the
    bag, click on the (bag icon) then click the "Clear" button.
