Logging In
----------

When you first arrive at |the DE|, you'll see the Dashboard. The Dashboard contains links to news, CyVerse videos, and a list of recently added public apps you can use. The left sidebar shows icons for accessing Data, Apps, Analyses, Teams, and Help.

We welcome you to freely explore the Dashboard, but to perform any tasks, you must have an account and be logged in.

*About the Dashboard*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Dashboard provides an overview of recent activity in CyVerse and the Discovery Environment. Your recently launched analyses, newly integrated apps that you've been working on, and other activity will show on the Dashboard, as well as CyVerse-related news and events, video tutorials, and newly released public apps.


*Logging in*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To log in from the Dashboard, click the |profile icon| in the upper right corner of the DE, or click `SIGN IN` when you encounter this message:

|DE Login Required|

1. Log in to the Discovery Environment at |discovery environment| with your username and password.

.. Tip::    If you forgot your password, you can reset it at the |CyVerse User Portal|.

2. After logging in with your username and password, you'll be returned to the previous view. For example, if you were on the Apps view when you clicked `SIGN IN[d]`, you'll return to that view.

You can take a short tour of the DE's main features by clicking the |Help| icon in the left sidebar and selecting "Product Tour".
