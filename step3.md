# Using Apps in the Discovery Environment

You can select from several hundred applications (apps) available in the
Discovery Environment when you are ready to analyze your data.

::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

When launching an app, you can log out or navigate to another page or
operation after you start the task; an automated email notification is
sent to you when those tasks are completed.
:::

## *Browsing Apps in the Discovery Environment*

You must be logged in to browse and use apps.

1\. Click in the left sidebar of the DE to see the Apps view. When you
first access the Apps view, you may be prompted to log in. After logging
in, you will see a screen that looks something like this:

## *Sorting and Filtering Apps in the Discovery Environment*

To sort the list of apps in ascending or descending order by app name,
the name of the person who integrated the app in CyVerse, or its average
rating, click on the column headings.

You can navigate between pages and change how many apps are listed on a
page by using the \< or \> controls at the bottom of the page.

By default, the Apps view displays all apps that are available to you.
With hundreds of apps and sometimes many versions of an app in the DE,
you may want to view a subset of all available apps. There are two ways
to do this. First, in the upper left corner of the Apps view, the
currently active subset of apps is shown as the primary filter. Click
the drop-down arrow next to the currently active subset to select a
different apps subset to display:

The currently selected app subset is highlighted in gray. The available
app subsets are:

  Application type             Description
  ---------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Apps under development       Apps that you have added to the DE that have not been made public
  Favorite apps                Apps that you have marked as favorite apps in the DE
  My public apps               Apps that you have added to the DE that have been made publicly available
  Shared with me               Apps that other users have shared with you
  High-Performance Computing   Apps that run at the Texas Advanced Computing Center using the
  Browse All Apps              All apps available to you in the DE

You can further reduce the list of the apps displayed by selecting a
filter. Click the drop-down arrow in the Filter control (upper right
corner of the Apps view) to select the type of apps you\'d like to see
in the listing:

The currently selected filter is displayed in the Filter control itself.
If no filter is selected, the control will be empty. The currently
available app filters are:

  Application filter            Description
  ----------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  HPC                           High Performance Computing apps that run using the (formerly known as Agave)
  DE                            Executable (non-interactive apps) that run on CyVerse computing resources
  VICE (formerly Interactive)   Interactive apps (e.g., Jupyter, RStudio, R Shiny) and other apps with their own interactive interfaces
  Open Science Grid (OSG)       Executable (non-interactive apps) that run on OSG resources

The app filter you selected will be displayed in the Filter control. To
dismiss a filter, click the [X]{.title-ref} to the right of the filter
name.

## *Viewing App Details in the Discovery Environment*

When you\'ve found an app of interest, select it by clicking the
checkbox to the left of the app name. A *Details* button will appear in
the upper right corner of the Apps view, just to the right of the Filter
control.

Click the Details button to see additional information about the app
(e.g., description, number of times run, etc.).

The Details panel has several controls available. Click the Heart icon
to add that app to your list of favorite apps (to remove from your
favorite list, click the heart again). The heart will be solid blue if
the app is already on your list of favorites. Click the Link icon to
display a link to the app that you can copy and share with other CyVerse
users. The Stars icon labeled `Your rating`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} allows you to rate the app. The
`Tools used by this App`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab contains
information about the underlying tools (steps) the app uses to perform
an analysis. To dismiss the App Details view, click anywhere outside the
panel.

## *About VICE Apps in the Discovery Environment*

One type of app that you can filter for in the Discovery Environment is
VICE apps (VICE stands for Visual Interactive Computing Environment and
is a part of the Discovery Environment). VICE apps are executable apps
that run as workflows on high performance or high throughput computing
environments and include a Graphical User Interface (GUI) or an
Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Project Jupyter,
RStudio, or remote desktops to the DE.

You must request access and be approved to use VICE apps through the
CyVerse User Portal .

## *Advanced Features in the Discovery Environment*

The Discovery Environment also supports advanced features for apps such
as integrating different types of apps into the DE, creating and running
containers, and using Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for
programmatic backend access to CyVerse services. For how-to information
on these features, see our , , and our .
