Logging In
----------

The Discovery Environment (DE) was designed to be an all-purpose bioinformatics
workbench â€“ tailored to the needs of biologists who have data to analyze but who
may not have command line expertise. Many popular bioinformatics analyses and
workflows (e.g. genome assembly, RNA-Seq, phylogeny methods, GWAS, etc.) can be
done from start to finish within the DE.

**Some things to remember about the DE**

- Your analyses are not limited by your computer. All computation in the
  Discovery Environment runs on CyVerse resources. You can connect from your
  laptop or phone and run jobs large and small.
- Once you launch a job it will run until completion. You can logout once a job
  is run; by default, you will get an email notification when the job completes.
